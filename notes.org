* Notes

Some useful notes while building my emacs confing.

*** End of file during parsing error

If there is a syntax error, emacs complains about it without being specific.

1. Use =M-x check-parens RET= to pinpoint the location of the current error.
2. Also enable =show-paren-mode= to see which parenthesis matches the current one.

*** Break long lilnes

1. Set =truncate-line= to =nil= for all buffers or any specific buffer.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; For all buffers
(setq truncate-lines nil)

;; For a specific buffer
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (setq truncate-lines nil)))
#+END_SRC


2. Use =M-x fill-paragraph= to break long lines into multiple short ones. (short-cut =M-q=)

*** Eval on tiny-buffer
Use =M-:= to quickly eval some elisp

*** Unset a key
    =(global-unset-key (kbd "C-M-j"))=
